SafeSenora is a cross platform app built on <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs">Flutter</a> which is based on single dart codebase and allows to run on both android and ios platforms .

This app is a try by us to ensure and increase women safety/protection in case of doubtful or any emergency situation .

Since Women safety is one of the major issues coming from the past and everyone has a chance to live with freedom , so this app is a contribution by us to the nation .

We have gone through some articles about how this problem is created or happening in the society . After analysing those articles we came up with some hybrid concepts involving old and new methods to increase more safety . 

Idea of community concern is the major concept used , while building this app . Helping a person at the right time and at the correct place is the best help that one can provide to anyone.

As students of computer science we have tried our best to make something for the benefit of society.

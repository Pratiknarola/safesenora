<b>SafeSenora</b> is cross platform App built with <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs">Flutter</a> using common-code base developed using <a href="https://dart.dev/guides">Dart</a>.
SafeSenora means to Safe Women in case of a doubtful or an emergency situation .

We BugHunters would like to say something: As we all know that Women safety is one of the major issues coming from the past, becuase all has the chance to live with freedom.

As Computer Science Students we have tried our best to make something for the society.
We believe in the Idea of Community concern i.e. helping one person might not change the whole world, but it could change the world for one person. Helping a person at the right time and at the correct place would be the best help that one can provide to anyone.

If you want to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.
How to make a clean pull request


   - Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
   - Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
   - If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
   - Create a new branch to work on! Branch from develop if it exists, else from master.
   - Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
   - Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
   - If the project has tests run them!
   - Write or adapt tests as needed.
   - Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.
   - Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
    From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's develop branch if there is one, else go for master!
    ...

    Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).

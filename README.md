SafeSenora is a cross platform app built on <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs">Flutter</a> from a single codebase.

SafeSenora means to Safe Women in case of doubtful or any emergency situation .

We BugHunters would like to say something: As we all know that Women safety is one of the major issues coming from the past, becuase all has the chance to live with freedom.

As Computer Science Students we have tried our best to make something for the society.
We believe in the Idea of Community concern i.e. helping one person might not change the whole world, but it could change the world for one person. Helping a person at the right time and at the correct place would be the best help that one can provide to anyone.
